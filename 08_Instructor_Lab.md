# Instructor-led Lab: Advanced Data Manipulation

In this assignment you will practice your new skills in data manipulation with the *piping* expression for `pandas`. Please follow the instructions below.

## Sorting and Ordering Data

Last week you sorted, ordered, and filtered the data [github_teams.csv](/data/github_teams.csv) using basic pandas techniques. Now that you have learned to use advanced techniques relying on piping expressions, you will perform the similar operations again, but with your new skills. 

Please perform the following operations in order:

* Select the columns `Team_type`, `human_work`, and `work_per_human`.
* Select columns that end in the letter `t`. Use the regex `t$`.
* Sort your data descending using the columns `Team_size_class`, `human_work`, `work_per_human`.
* Select `human-bot` teams that have a `bot_members_count` value greater than and equal to 3.
* Find the `human` teams that are `Large` and have a `human_gini` value greater than and equal to 0.75.
* How many teams are in the `Small` or `Large` category?
* How many teams are in the `Small` or `Large` category with a `human_gini` value less than and equal to 0.25?
* How many `human` teams are in the `Medium` category?
* Save the columns `Team_size_class` and `work_per_human` as a new DataFrame.
* Rename these two columns in a new DataFrame: change `human_gini` to `work_inequality` and `eval_survival_day_median` to `issue_resolution_time`.

## Dataset Contents

| Variable  | Description | 
| :------------ |:---------------|
| name_h | Alphanumeric hash generated to anonymize repo name |
| Team_type |  A qualitative descriptor indicating whether the team was made of only humans or a blend of humans and bots (two levels: human, human-bot) |
| Team_size_class |  A qualitative descriptor indicating the size of the team, derived from human_members_count (three levels: small [2, 3], medium [4, 6], large [7, 246]) |
| human_members_count  | The number of human users in the repo |
| bot_members_count | The number of bots in the repo |
| human_work | The number of work events generated by humans in the repo |
| work_per_human | The ratio of works events to humans, derived from human_members_count and human_work |
| human_gini | Gini coefficient for human work in the repo |
| human_Push | The number of push events generated by humans in the repo |
| human_IssueComments | The number of issue comment events generated by humans in the repo |
| human_PRReviewComment | The number of pull request review comment events generated by humans in the repo |
| human_MergedPR | The number of merged pull request events generated by humans in the repo |
| bot_work | The number of work events generated by bots in the repo |
| bot_Push | The number of push events generated by bots in the repo |
| bot_IssueComments | The number of issue comment events generated by bots in the repo |
| bot_PRReviewComment | The number of pull request review comment events generated by bots in the repo |
| bot_MergedPR | The number of merged pull request events generated by bots in the repo |
| eval_survival_day_median | The median number of days that an issue remained open in the repo (teams who were not included in issue survival analysis have NA value) |
| issues_count | The number of issues in the repo |
